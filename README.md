## Background
Many websites have collection functions that mostly cannot be customized, and there is no guarantee that data will not be lost. As time goes by, in my case I can only regret when I find that I have lost. Therefore, this program is developped to remember what is worth.

## Install
### Open with installer
Download the released executable file, double click `install.exe` to finish installation or use portable version for quick start. 
### Open with Qt5
Another choice is to open with Qt5 after downloading the source code. Clone the source code to an empty fold, then click `.pro.user` to open project when ensuring Qt5 is already installed.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pisuto/MyFavorQt.git
```

## Usage
After finishing the installation step, setup `MyFavor-vX.X.X.exe`.
