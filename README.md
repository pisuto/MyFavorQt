## Background
Many websites have collection functions that mostly cannot be customized, and there is no guarantee that data will not be lost. As time goes by, in my case I can only regret when I find that I have lost. Therefore, this program is developped to remember what is worth.

## Install
### Open with installer
Download the released executable file, double click `install.exe` to finish installation or use portable version for quick start. 
### Open with Qt5
Another choice is to open with Qt5 after downloading the source code. Clone the source code to an empty fold, then ensure Qt5 is already installed and click `.pro.user` to open project.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pisuto/MyFavorQt.git
```

## Usage
After finishing the installation step, setup `MyFavor-vX.X.X.exe`.
